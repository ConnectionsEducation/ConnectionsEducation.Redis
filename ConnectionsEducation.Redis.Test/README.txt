Prior to running the tests, run redis on localhost, or change the host used in the test.
The [AssemblyInitialize] method in RedisTest.cs should do this.

Get redis from https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis/blob/2.8/bin/release/redis-2.8.9.zip

or build from source https://github.com/MSOpenTech/redis
